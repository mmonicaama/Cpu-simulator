CPU Simulator Program in c++
This is a CPU simulator program implemented in c++. The program simulates a pseudo-abstract CPU with six registers and a pseudo-abstract memory. The CPU supports basic operations such as moving data between registers, performing arithmetic operations, comparing values, and jumping to different instructions based on conditions.

CPU Registers
The CPU has six registers:
AYB (Accumulator Register): The result of any operation is automatically saved in this register.
BEN: General-purpose register.
GIM: General-purpose register.
DA: General-purpose register.
EC: General-purpose register.
ZA (Flagger Register): Stores the results of arithmetic operations and comparison results.
Memory
The memory consists of 32 addresses, each representing two byte of data. The CPU does not work with values larger than one byte.
Supported Instructions
The CPU supports the following instructions:
MOV: Move data between registers or between a register and memory.
ADD: Add two values and store the result in the AYB register.
SUB: Subtract one value from another and store the result in the AYB register.
MUL: Multiply two values and store the result in the AYB register.
DIV: Divide one value by another and store the result in the AYB register.
AND: Perform a bitwise AND operation between two values and store the result in the AYB register.
OR: Perform a bitwise OR operation between two values and store the result in the AYB register.
NOT: Perform a bitwise NOT operation on a value and store the result in the AYB register.
CMP: Compare two values and store the result in the DA register.
JMP: Unconditionally jump to a specified address.
JG: Jump to a specified address if the result of the previous comparison is greater than zero.
JL: Jump to a specified address if the result of the previous comparison is less than zero.
JE: Jump to a specified address if the result of the previous comparison is equal to zero.
Execution
The program reads an assembly code file as an input argument. Each instruction is a value occupying two byte of space. The program size cannot exceed 32 bytes. After the execution, the contents of the memory are printed to the screen using the dumpMemory() function.
